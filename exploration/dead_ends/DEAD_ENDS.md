# Dead Ends Documentation

This file documents approaches that were tried but didn't work out. This is valuable information to prevent repeating the same mistakes and to understand the theory development process.

## Format for Documentation

### Attempt: [Brief Description]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Script**: `failed_*.py` (if applicable)  
**Hypothesis**: What we were trying to achieve  
**Approach**: How we tried to do it  
**Why it Failed**: Specific reasons for failure  
**Lessons Learned**: What we learned from this attempt  
**Related Ideas**: Any salvageable concepts

## Documented Dead Ends

*Dead ends will be documented here as we encounter them*

### Example Entry (Remove when adding real entries):
**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Script**: `failed_continuous_r0_scaling.py`  
**Hypothesis**: R₀ follows a single continuous power law across all scales  
**Approach**: Tried fitting R₀ ∝ M^α for various α values  
**Why it Failed**: Structure factors varied by 40+ orders of magnitude  
**Lessons Learned**: R₀ operates as discrete scale-specific domains  
**Related Ideas**: Hybrid continuous-discrete scaling within domains
