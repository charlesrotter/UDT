# Exploration Directory

This directory contains experimental work, musings, and theoretical explorations for UDT development. Contents here are NOT part of the main theory implementation and will be cleaned up before publication.

## Directory Structure

### `/musings/`
Theoretical explorations and "what if" scenarios. May contain:
- Alternative formulations of UDT
- Extensions to new domains
- Speculative connections to other physics
- Mathematical explorations

### `/promising/`
Experiments that show potential but need more work:
- Partially successful implementations
- Ideas worth revisiting
- Preliminary analyses that need refinement

### `/dead_ends/`
Failed attempts kept for reference:
- Approaches that didn't work out
- Document why they failed (valuable learning!)
- Prevent revisiting same mistakes

### `/drafts/`
Draft scripts and analyses before integration:
- Work-in-progress implementations
- Rough calculations
- Preliminary visualizations

## Naming Conventions

Use clear prefixes to indicate status:
- `experimental_*.py` - Active experiments
- `draft_*.py` - Draft implementations
- `failed_*.py` - Documented failures
- `musing_*.py` - Theoretical explorations
- `test_idea_*.py` - Quick concept tests

## Cleanup Protocol

Before publication:
1. Move successful experiments to main codebase
2. Archive this entire directory
3. Remove from git history if needed
4. Document key learnings in main docs

## Current Explorations

*List active explorations here as we work on them*

**Note**: This is a working directory. Code quality standards are relaxed here to encourage exploration. Do NOT reference these scripts from main codebase.
