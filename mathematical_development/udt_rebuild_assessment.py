UDT Rebuild Assessment
======================

Given the fundamental flaws discovered, assess whether UDT can be rebuilt
from scratch with proper mathematical rigor and physical validity.

Key questions:
1. What are the salvageable core insights?
2. How can we ensure general covariance?
3. What physical postulates are actually defensible?
4. Can we derive rather than assume key functions?
5. Is this worth the effort vs pursuing other theories?
