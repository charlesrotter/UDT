UDT Postulate-Based Approach: tau(r) as Fundamental Geometric Postulate
====================================================================

SCIENTIFIC APPROACH: Instead of deriving tau(r) from other physics,
treat tau(r) = R_0/(R_0 + r) as a FUNDAMENTAL POSTULATE about spacetime geometry
and derive all other physics from it.

POSTULATE: "Spacetime has intrinsic temporal geometric structure tau(r) = R_0/(R_0 + r)"

This approach follows Einstein's method of using fundamental postulates
to derive all physics from basic geometric principles.
