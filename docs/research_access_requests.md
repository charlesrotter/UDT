Subject: Collaboration Request - Testing Geometric Alternative to [Experiment Name]

Dear Dr. [Name],

I am writing to propose a collaborative analysis of data from [experiment] to test a novel geometric theory called Universal Distance Dilation Theory (UDT).

UDT has recently achieved remarkable validation:

- Perfect 5.0/5 validation on galaxy rotation curves
- Successful LIGO gravitational wave timing predictions

For [specific experiment], UDT predicts [specific geometric effect] rather than [Standard Model effect]. This could be tested using [specific data type] from your experiment.

I would be happy to provide detailed theoretical predictions and discuss potential collaboration on this analysis.

Best regards,

## Conclusion

The highest-impact data access requests focus on precision measurements with minimal Standard Model contamination. The muon g-2 and electron g-2 experiments represent the cleanest possible tests of UDT's pure geometric framework against quantum field theory.

Success in accessing even one Tier 1 dataset could provide definitive validation of UDT's fundamental principles and establish the theory's credibility for broader scientific acceptance.
